Task 1:

Fetching the employee to create reporting structure didn't fetched the other sub employees of employees under direct report,
so I added a method to initialize all the sub employees in order to create a proper tree structure in results.

Task 2:

created methods for create and read same as what the employee had in different controller, service and repo

--- Added tests that checks the functions of the services

1. reporting structure
2. create and read for compensation
